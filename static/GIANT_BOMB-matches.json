The player starts with the option of choosing one of four separate hero characters (each of which sporting their own <a href=\"/palette-swap/3015-1434/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1434\">palette swaps</a> for visual variety). Next, as a slight customization method, you're asked a handful of questions to determine the chosen hero's starting statistics. At each level up, you can tailor your stats to meet your characters needs at each level up; each successive gained level offers even more stat points to distribute as you see fit. Any hero character can use any of the following weapons to meet the player's play-style: the sword, the axe, the spear, the staff, and the bow &amp; arrow. </p><p>The player character's objective is simple : wipe out the monsters threatening town. To do so the player repeatedly dives into a dungeon called the Abyss, which acts as a spawning ground for the monsters that rampage the town.  Each level of the Abyss consists of 3 <a href=\"/randomly-generated-dungeons/3015-167/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-167\">procedurally generated</a> stages followed by a boss level. Once the boss is defeated, the player is awarded a sum of Lufia (the in game <a href=\"/currency/3015-575/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-575\">currency</a> in From the Abyss) by the town's queen and she grants the player access to a lower level into the Abyss. There are 8 levels of the Abyss in total.</p><p>Each abyss is home to standard monsters that happily await their death by the hero's weapon of choice (usually through a swift attack combo), but others require a more tactical approach. This is where skills come into play, and, more specifically, how these abilities are acquired. Similar to the Final Fantasy <a href=\"/hume-blue-mage/3015-775/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-775\">Blue Mage</a> job class; the hero learns their abilities by copying one from a weakened foe. The difference is that the character captures the enemy in question to absorb a skill (which is accessible from then-on out). He/she first damages the enemy as much as possible (the lower the remaining energy, the higher the success rate). Then a Soul Capture is then performed to harness the skills of your opponent (this applies only to the first time capturing a particular critter; HP is gained any other time).</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid": "3030-22044", "id": 22044, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/87790/2188503-box_fta.png", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22044/?filter=image_tag:All%20Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 18}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22044/?filter=image_tag:Box%20Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 3}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22044/?filter=image_tag:DS%20Screenshots", "name": "DS Screenshots", "total": 6}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22044/?filter=image_tag:Screenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 15}], "name": "From the Abyss", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/", "id": 25, "name": "CERO: A"}], "original_release_date": "2008-08-31", "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/", "id": 52, "name": "Nintendo DS", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/", "abbreviation": "DS"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/from-the-abyss/3030-22044/", "resource_type": "game"}, "validation_info": {"py/object": "match_validator.ValidationInfo", "matched": true, "exact": true, "platform_matched": true, "date_matched": true}}, "1719": {"py/object": "game_match.GameMatch", "title": "Unavowed", "url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/unavowed/3030-56702/", "id": "3030-56702", "match_info": {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-56702/", "date_added": "2016-10-16 09:44:54", "date_last_updated": "2021-07-07 15:18:44", "deck": "An urban fantasy adventure game from Wadjet Eye Games.", "description": "<h3>Overview</h3><p>Unavowed is a game by David Gilbert of Wadjet Eye games, and to date, it is their most ambitious game they've made so far, combing roleplaying character build options with their renowned story driven point and click adventure gameplay.

Rescuing any of the civilians scattered across the maps increases the size of the player's team, which in turn has an effect on the overall power of attacks.</p><p>Because of its group-based nature, the game is played from a top-down, three-quarters perspective with the camera pulled out for scale. At its distance, it's possible to control even large groups of heroes but individual character models are displayed small in relation.</p><h3>Unite Team</h3><p>Unite Team moves are special formations and moves created by forming the heroes into specific shapes through two possible methods; by either drawing a shape directly onto the Wii U GamePad touchscreen or through the use of the right thumbstick. This mechanic is conceptually similar to the celestial brush in <a href=\"/okami/3030-20555/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20555\">Okami</a>.</p><p>By combining the heroes into a single larger object, the team can create weapons to be used in combat or context-specific support equipment such as hang gliders, bridges and ladders. Using these Unite Team special attacks expends energy from a battery meter, but they can be recharged with basic Unite Attacks. The meter can be lengthened one battery at a time by collecting batteries found throughout the world.</p><p>For greater strategic depth, it is possible to use more than one Unite formation at once. For example, shapes for both the Unite Hand and Unite Sword can be used in succession to divide the player's team into both and have them fight simultaneously.</p><h3>Wii U Touchscreen</h3><p>While much of the Wii U's touchscreen functionality allows the player to draw shapes to quickly access Unite Team weapons, there are moments where the display is used for other purposes. When inside buildings, for example, the touchscreen displays the building's interior, while the building exterior is displayed on the television. This allows for puzzles such as a combination lock in which the numerical displays are only visible outside the building (on the TV), but the dials to change the combination and the combination itself are located inside, on the touchscreen.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The game features a local-only competitive co-op mode for up to five players with support for the Wii U Pro Controller or Wii Classic Controller Pro. Players have to work together to defeat enemies but are ultimately competing for high scores against each other. If one player dies, everyone has to start over.</p><h2>Aesthetic</h2><p>Where The Wonderful 101's core gameplay necessitates a large sense of scale, it also creates a specific aesthetic. The perspective evokes the idea of playing with action figures. As enemies are destroyed, they break apart and reveal metal frames and toy-like parts. With character designs similar to the ones found in <a href=\"/viewtiful-joe/3025-233/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-233\">Viewtiful Joe</a>, the game has a look reminiscent of Japanese <a href=\"/tokusatsu/3015-1193/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1193\">tokusatsu</a> in the vein of <em>Super Sentai</em> and <em>Kamen Rider</em>.</p><h2>Origins</h2><p>According to Hideki Kamiya at <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/pax-prime-2013/3015-7596/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7596\">PAX Prime 2013</a>, the game that became The Wonderful 101 began life as a title that was to feature an all-star roster of Nintendo characters. This game featured similar gameplay concepts in the unite morphs. However, the pitch to Nintendo was rejected when part of the pitch involved an image of Princess Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi being used as a bridge by Mario; a concept that those involved at Nintendo did not approve of. The idea was subsequently reworked, replacing the Nintendo characters with the new hero characters found in the final game.</p><h2>Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>On February 3rd 2020 Platinum games launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund and self-publish a Nintendo Switch port of the game. The campaign's initial goal of 50,000 USD was met within 30 minutes of the campaign launching. Stretch goals for Steam and PS4 versions were also met within hours.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid": "3030-38553", "id": 38553, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_large/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/square_mini/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/8/82063/2684494-clean101.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:All%20Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 234}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:Artwork", "name": "Artwork", "total": 16}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:Box%20Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 8}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:Concept%20Art", "name": "Concept Art", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:PAX%20East%202013", "name": "PAX East 2013", "total": 2}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:PAX%20Prime%202012", "name": "PAX Prime 2012", "total": 2}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:Pax%20Prime%202013", "name": "Pax Prime 2013", "total": 3}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-38553/?filter=image_tag:Screenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 198}], "name": "The Wonderful 101", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/", "id": 1, "name": "ESRB: T"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-33/", "id": 33, "name": "CERO: B"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/", "id": 38, "name": "OFLC: PG"}], "original_release_date": "2013-08-23", "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/", "id": 146, "name": "PlayStation 4", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/", "abbreviation": "PS4"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-157/", "id": 157, "name": "Nintendo Switch", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-switch/3045-157/", "abbreviation": "NSW"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-199/", "id": 199, "name": "Amazon Luna", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/amazon-luna/3045-199/", "abbreviation": "LUNA"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/the-wonderful-101/3030-38553/", "resource_type": "game"}, "validation_info": {"py/object": "match_validator.ValidationInfo", "matched": true, "exact": false, "platform_matched": true, "date_matched": false}}, "3976": {"py/object": "game_match.GameMatch", "title": "Sniper Elite V2", "url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/sniper-elite-v2/3030-34715/", "id": "3030-34715", "match_info": {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34715/", "date_added": "2011-04-06 14:06:27", "date_last_updated": "2019-07-10 12:27:33", "deck": "Sniper Elite V2 is a reboot to the tactical third person shooter Sniper Elite.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Sniper Elite V2 is a sniper action game set in World War II that follows <a href=\"/karl-fairburne/3005-14459/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14459\">Karl Fairburne</a>, an allied Sniper that is behind the enemy lines during the Battle of Berlin.

Players will also be able to use the environment to their advantage, such as using loud noises in the area to mask the sound of the sniper rifle.</p><p>Physics will be a big part of the game. Examples include taking into consideration all three coordinates, and bullet drop caused by gravity, crosswinds, as well as muzzle velocity. One will have to aim accordingly to compensate for these factors.</p><ul><li>Firing at explosive components (such as grenades hanging on someone's belt) to take out a group of enemies.</li><li>An improved real-time, dynamic \"Killcam\" that explicitly portrays the bullet penetrating organs/skeleton.</li><li>Improved ballistics.</li><li>Players will be able to drag bodies and use them as bait to attract nearby enemies.</li><li>Heart rate will be one of the factors to watch out for when aiming.</li></ul><h4>Difficulty Levels</h4><ul><li>Cadet - There are no bullet ballistics enabled.</li><li>Marksman - There are simplified bullet ballistics.</li><li>Sniper Elite - There are realistic bullet ballistics.</li></ul><h3>Custom Difficulty</h3><p>A feature of Sniper Elite V2 is the ability to set very defined, custom difficulty settings altering the physics and assists rendered in the game.</p><p>The custom difficult options are:</p><h4>Enemy Skill</h4><ul><li>Rookie - Enemies will offer limited resistance.</li><li>Veteran - The enemies in the game will challenge you.</li><li>Elite - Enemies will work together in teams and try to hunt you down.</li></ul><h4>Ballistic Realism</h4><ul><li>Simple - The player will always have steady aim and bullets will fly in straight lines unaffected by wind nor gravity.</li><li>Limited - Gravity will affect bullets and the players scope will be slightly less steady.</li><li>Realistic - Both gravity and wind will affect player bullets and you will need to monitor your heart rate closely while taking shots.</li></ul><p>Tactical Assistance</p><ul><li>None - All artificial assistance is disabled in the game, provides the most realistic sniping simulation.</li><li>Moderate - The threat indicator, ghost image, enemy tagging and aim assistance are all enabled.</li><li>Full - All artificial assistance is enabled in the game and the aim assist reticule when aiming down the scope appears quicker than usual.</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer Modes</h2><p>Sniper Elite V2 features several multiplayers modes both competetive and cooperative alike although the Team Deathmatch mode is unique to the PC version of the game. The remaining online modes are available on all platforms (XBOX 360, Playstation 3, PC) All online modes are restricted to online only and so far there is no support for split screen gameplay.</p><h3>Campaign</h3><p>The entire campaign story-mode of Sniper Elite V2 can be played with a friend cooperatively.</p><h3>Team Deathmatch (PC Only)</h3><p>Supports up to 12 players in a single match - two teams of snipers face off against one another.</p><h3>Deathmatch</h3><p>Free for all mode where you face off against other snipers in a closed off 'arena.'</p><h3>Kill Tally</h3><p>A take on horde mode gameplay.
